\section{Problem A}
	\subsection{Statement}
		Given an $N \times N$ array of characters, and the ability to swap any two adjacent characters 
		in the same row any number of times, determine if it is possible to get an array
		where every row is sorted, and every column is also sorted.

	\subsection{Solution}
		Note that there is exactly one configuration in which the rows are sorted, which is achievable
		because we have a swap operation. So we just have to reach this configuration, and check whether 
		it satisfies the second requirement also.
		You can use any sorting algorithm which is $O(N^2)$ to sort.
		Of course it is convenient to use your language's \verb|sort()| function.
